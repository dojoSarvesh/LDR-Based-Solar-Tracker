# LDR-Based-Solar-Tracker
# 🌞 Solar Panel Auto Sun Tracker using 4 LDRs

This project demonstrates a **smart solar panel system** that automatically tracks the sun using **4 photoresistors (LDRs)** to maximize energy absorption. The system adjusts the angle of the solar panel based on real-time sunlight detection.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Solar Panel
- 4x LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 4x Resistors (10kΩ recommended)
- Servo Motor / Stepper Motor (as per your setup)
- Arduino UNO (or compatible microcontroller)
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
The 4 LDRs are arranged in a cross pattern around a divider. They detect the light intensity from different directions. The microcontroller compares the readings and moves the panel in the direction where light is strongest, allowing the panel to follow the sun throughout the day.
